# Connecting Redux

1. Setup Redux 
    - install necessary deps 
    - create store 
    - create root reducer
2. Model our redux store 
    - create reducers
        - bookmarks 
        - reviews 
    - add data to store post-fetch

NOTE: reviews frontend is not created, so we'll add the slice of reviews state, but not the React part of it, for the sake of time
