// First let's create our store here... to do this we need to create our rootReducer
// import rootReducer from "../reducers/rootreducer"
// import createStore from "redux"
// import devToolsEnhancer from "redux-devtools-extension"


//create our store const by passing our createStore function our rootReducer and devToolsEnhancer 
// **NOTE** devToolsEnhancer is a function so we need to invoke it
// At some point it may be useful for you to pass middlewares to your createStore function rather than or in addition to 
// an enhancer, however, this is out of the scope for todays lecture....


//export our store
