| Node          | The building blocks of a tree.                                                                                                                  |
| Link          | A connection from a node to another node. Links in trees are _unidirectional_, meaning that they connect two nodes with a particular direction. |
| Edge          | Another term another for a Link.                                                                                                                |
| Root          | The node at the "top" of the tree. The root node is the only node without parents.                                                              |
| Parent        | Any node that is "above" other nodes. Parent nodes must have at least one or more children.                                                     |
| Child         | Any node that is "below" other nodes. A child node has a single parent.                                                                         |
| Sibling       | Nodes that share the same parent node are called siblings.                                                                                      |
| Leaf Node     | A node that does not have any children.                                                                                                         |
| Internal Node | Any node that has a child.                                                                                                                      |
| Height        | Taking the longest path, the number of edges from the root to the node farthest from it.                                                        |
| Depth         | The length of the path from root to a particular node.                                                                                          |
