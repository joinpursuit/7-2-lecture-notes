# Data Structures

- A way of storing and organizing data so that it can be used effectively.
- We are already familiar with data structures in JavaScript
  - Arrays
  - Objects
  - Strings
  - Classes
- Abstract Data Types(ADTs) are more general than a specific implementation of a Data Strctures where we define only the behavior of the data type. i.e. ways that we can interact with the data
- Why is this important?
  - Algorithms often may demand a certain ADT that may be implemented in many different ways
  - Given a certain algorithim, it may only work if you use a certain ADT and will not work using other ADTs
