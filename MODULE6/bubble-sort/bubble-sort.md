# Bubble Sort

    - What is a sort?
        - The way that we as programmers use algorithms to organize our data
    - Why do we sort?
        - As programmers, we may have need to organize the data in a way that is useful.
        - Think back to our projects, may of us used sort to render data to your users in a particular order
    - What is Bubble Sort?
        - Bubble Sort is generally the first major sorting algorithm to come up in most introductory programming courses
        - Learning about this algorithm is useful educationally...
        - But we probably do want to use it in actual practice to sort things
            - Its not very efficient
            - It not generally used (mostly because there are better ways to sort)
            - Super l33t programmers will judge you... so don't be that person
    - What does Bubble Sort do?
        - If we were sorting an array, when we say that an element "bubbles up,":
            - The item is in motion.
            - The item is moving in some direction.
            - The item has some final resting destination.
